<h1>The Maple Leafs Rebuild</h1>
<p>The Toronto Maple Leafs had officaily announced their rebuild in February of last year, and almost a year after it seems as they are on a good track. It's safe to say that they haven't had many mistakes or bumps in the way and are doing a better job than past managements. The offseason was a major stepping stone for the rebuild as major trades were made and the leafs made a huge splash in the off season last year by signing the biggest free agent, Mike Babcock. That gave the fans a reason to actually belive in Shanahan and co. and not think that this will end up as the past rebuild. This year they are on a good path to finish last in standings and have the best chances to recieve the first draft pick, also they have been linked to center Steven Stamkos. Also they decided to rebrand themselves for the 100th year anniversery next year which shows they do not want to be stuck in the past. So in the end I would like to say that the future is bright for the leafs and they are on a path to becoming a contender in a few years  .</p>
